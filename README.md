# wicg-tracker

This project is for maintaining an overview of initiatives proposed as part of the Web Platform Incubator Community Group, akin to the way the [Chromium Dashboard](https://www.chromestatus.com/features) tracks the status of full-fledged W3C standards.

Individual proposals are tracked [in the wiki](https://github.com/stuartpb/wicg-tracker/wiki).
